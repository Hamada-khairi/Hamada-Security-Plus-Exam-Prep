Passive reconnaissance\r\nPassive reconnaissance focuses on gathering as much information from\r\nopen sources such as social media, corporate websites, and business\r\norganizations.\r\nThe incorrect answers:\r\nA. Vulnerability scanning\r\nSome active reconnaissance tests will query systems directly to see if a\r\nvulnerability currently exists.\r\nC. Supply chain analysis\r\nA supply chain analysis will examine the security associated with a\r\nsupplier, and the analysis will not provide any information regarding a\r\ncompany's own servers and data.\r\nD. Regulatory audit\r\nA regulatory audit is a detailed security analysis based on existing laws or\r\nprivate guidelines. A regulatory audit commonly requires access to internal\r\nsystems and data.",

Enable time-of-day restrictions on\r\nthe authentication server\r\nAdding location-based policies will prevent direct data access from outside\r\nof the country. Saving log information from all devices and creating audit\r\nreports from a single database can be implemented through the use of a\r\nSIEM (Security Information and Event Manager). Adding a check for the\r\ntime-of-day will report any access that occurs during non-working hours.\r\n\r\nThe incorrect answers:\r\nB. Require government-issued identification during the\r\nonboarding process\r\nRequiring proper identification is always a good idea, but it’s not one of\r\nthe listed requirements.\r\nC. Add additional password complexity for accounts that access data\r\nAdditional password complexity is another good best practice, but it’s not\r\npart of the provided requirements.\r\nD. Conduct monthly permission auditing\r\nNo requirements for ongoing auditing were included in the requirements,\r\nbut ongoing auditing is always an important consideration.\r\nF. Archive the encryption keys of all disabled accounts\r\nIf an account is disabled, there may still be encrypted data that needs to be\r\nrecovered later. Archiving the encryption keys will allow access to that data\r\nafter the account is no longer in use.",

If the password isn't discovered in\r\nthose few attempts, the brute force process stops before any account\r\nlockouts occur. An attacker could potentially perform a spraying attack\r\nacross many accounts without any noticeable alerts or alarms.\r\nThe incorrect answers:\r\nA. Downgrade attack\r\nA downgrade attack takes advantage of a cryptographic weakness or\r\nvulnerability to gain access. This weakness is often due to an unpatched\r\napplication or a poorly implemented cryptographic process. In this\r\nexample, the attack is focused on a small number of brute force attempts\r\nand not on a cryptographic issue.\r\nB. Phishing\r\nPhishing is a useful attack for gathering information. Since a phishing\r\nattack often gathers valid authentication details, it's not necessary for the\r\nphishing process to also perform a brute force attack.\r\nC. Injection\r\nAn injection attack adds additional information to a data stream in an\r\nattempt to access systems or data which would normally not be accessible.\r\nAn injection attack does not generally perform a brute force attack.",

Add a content filter rule\r\nWeb filters contain a large database of categorized website addresses, and\r\nthis allows an administrator to create rules to block browsing attempts to\r\nspecific content. For example, a content filter may allow browsing to news\r\nand business sites, but block browsing attempts to gaming and shopping\r\nsites.\r\nThe incorrect answers:\r\nA. Tune the IPS signatures\r\nAn IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) can identify and block known\r\nexploits within network traffic. An IPS does not maintain a categorized\r\nlist of websites, and tuning the IPS signatures would not block specific\r\nwebsite categories.\r\nB. Block port tcp/443 on the firewall\r\nBlocking a single port would not provide filtering on a specific website\r\ncategory.

When used with a RADIUS based authentication server it provides authentication services, checking user credentials to ensure that the user is a legitimate part of the organization and granting access to only those areas of the system that the user is allowed to access. Fail-open refers to what happens when a network encounters errors and exceptions.  Fail-open means that when errors occur or exceptions are encountered, the system continues allowing access rather than denying access. Fail-open allows a website to continue offering services even after an error has occurred. The emphasis is, therefore, keeping the website up while the error is addressed, hoping that the error is a minor issue.

In this way, it provides a layer of protection without slowing down network performance. Fail-close refers to what happens when a network encounters errors and exceptions. Fail-close means that when errors occur or exceptions are encountered, the system denies further access. This prevents any further network traffic until the error or exception are dealt with.

While IDS is valuable for identifying potential security incidents, it primarily focuses on network-level security and does not directly address the authenticity and integrity of software updates and it is not the most appropriate technique for ensuring the legitimacy of software updates. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a security method that requires users to provide two or more forms of identification before accessing a system.

This software helps protect systems and devices from known vulnerabilities. Patching is a mitigation technique that can help prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities on systems and devices by updating them with the latest security fixes and enhancements. Patching involves applying patches or updates to all software and systems, not just those that provide host security like firewalls. Least privilege is a mitigation technique that limits users to the level of access and privilege they need to do their work.  This can limit the extent of an attack by limiting the attacker’s access and privilege to those of the compromised user.  Least privilege involves applying predefined rules and permissions, such as roles, groups, and functions and enforcing the rules and permissions through mechanisms such as passwords, tokens, and biometrics. Default password changes is a hardening technique that can help prevent some password attacks on systems and devices.  This is done by changing the default or factory-set passwords that may be easily cracked by automated tools or dictionaries because they are often reused or drawn from a small pool of passwords. Password managers, password generators, and security policies can be used to create and enforce the use of strong and unique passwords for each system and device.

Providing unrestricted access to user account data without authentication or authorization is highly insecure and violates the principles of access management. OAuth's purpose is to provide controlled access to specific data, ensuring that third-party applications are authorized only for the data they require and nothing more. While generating random access tokens is a step in the right direction, sharing them directly with third-party applications is not recommended. OAuth operates on the principle of \"authorization delegation,\" where the user grants access to specific data to third-party applications. Access tokens should be issued by an authorization server and presented by the third-party application to access limited data on behalf of the user. Asking users to share their account credentials directly with third-party applications violates the core principle of OAuth, which is to avoid sharing credentials with third parties.

      "explanation": "Safety controls are security controls that are designed to protect human life and physical assets from harm or damage. \nExamples of safety controls include fire alarms, sprinklers, emergency exits, backup generators, and surge protectors. \nSafety controls should fail open, which means that they should remain operational or allow access when a failure or error \noccurs. Failing open can prevent or minimize the impact of a disaster, such as a fire, flood, earthquake, or power outage, on \nhuman life and physical assets. For example, if a fire alarm fails, it should still trigger the sprinklers and unlock the \nemergency exits, rather than remain silent and locked. Failing open can also ensure that essential services, such as \nhealthcare, transportation, or communication, are available during a crisis. Remote access points, logging controls, and \nlogical security controls are other types of security controls, but they should not fail open in a data center. Remote access \npoints are security controls that allow users or systems to access a network or a system from a remote location, such as a \nVPN, a web portal, or a wireless access point. Remote access points should fail closed, which means that they should deny \naccess when a failure or error occurs. Failing closed can prevent unauthorized or malicious access to the data center?s \nnetwork or systems, such as by hackers, malware, or rogue devices. Logging controls are security controls that record and \nmonitor the activities and events that occur on a network or a system, such as user actions, system errors, security incidents, \nor performance metrics. Logging controls should also fail closed, which means that they should stop or suspend the activities \nor events when a failure or error occurs. Failing closed can prevent data loss, corruption, or tampering, as well as ensure \ncompliance with regulations and standards. Logical security controls are security controls that use software or code to \nprotect data and systems from unauthorized or malicious access, modification, or destruction, such as encryption, \nauthentication, authorization, or firewall. Logical security controls should also fail closed, which means that they should block \nor restrict access when a failure or error occurs. Failing closed can prevent data breaches, cyberattacks, or logical flaws, as \nwell as ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and systems. \nReference: CompTIA Security+ Study Guide: Exam SY0-701, 9th Edition, page 142-143, 372-373, 376- 377",

Therefore, this is the best answer among the given options. \nThe other options are not as likely to be included as elements of communication in a security awareness program, because \nthey are either technical or operational tasks that are not directly related to the security awareness of the users and \nemployees. Detecting insider threats using anomalous behavior recognition is a technical task that involves using security \ntools or systems to monitor and analyze the activities and behaviors of the users and employees and identify any deviations \nor anomalies that may indicate malicious or unauthorized actions. This task is usually performed by the security team or the \nsecurity operations center, and it does not require the communication or participation of the users and employees. Verifying \ninformation when modifying wire transfer data is an operational task that involves using verification methods, such as phone \ncalls, emails, or digital signatures, to confirm the authenticity and accuracy of the information related to wire transfers, such \nas the account number, the amount, or the recipient. This task is usually performed by the financial or accounting \ndepartment, and it does not involve the security awareness of the users and employees. Performing social engineering as \npart of third-party penetration testing is a technical task that involves using deception or manipulation techniques, such as \n\n\nphishing, vishing, or impersonation, to test the security posture and the vulnerability of the users and employees to social \nengineering attacks.

The principle of \nleast privilege is a technique that grants users or systems the minimum level of access or permissions that they need to \nperform their tasks, and nothing more. By applying the principle of least privilege to a human resources fileshare, the \npermissions can be restricted to only those who have a legitimate need to access the sensitive data, such as HR staff, \nmanagers, or auditors. This can prevent unauthorized users, such as hackers, employees, or contractors, from accessing, \ncopying, modifying, or deleting the data.

      "explanation": "ARO (Annualized Rate of Occurrence) is an analysis element that measures the frequency or likelihood of an event \nhappening in a given year. ARO is often used in risk assessment and management, as it helps to estimate the potential loss \nor impact of an event. A company can use ARO to calculate the annualized loss expectancy (ALE) of an event, which is the \nproduct of ARO and the single loss expectancy (SLE). ALE represents the expected cost of an event per year, and can be \nused to compare with the cost of implementing a security control or purchasing an insurance policy. The company most likely \nused ARO in making the decision to remove the coverage for ransomware attacks from its cyber insurance policy. The \ncompany may have estimated the ARO of ransomware attacks based on historical data, industry trends, or threat \nintelligence, and found that the ARO was low or negligible. The company may have also calculated the ALE of ransomware \nattacks, and found that the ALE was lower than the cost of the insurance policy. Therefore, the company decided to reduce \nthe cost of its annual cyber insurance policy by removing the coverage for ransomware attacks, as it deemed the risk to be \nacceptable or manageable. \nIMTTR (Incident Management Team Training and Readiness), RTO (Recovery Time Objective), and MTBF (Mean Time \nBetween Failures) are not analysis elements that the company most likely used in making the decision to remove the \ncoverage for ransomware attacks from its cyber insurance policy. IMTTR is a process of preparing and training the incident \nmanagement team to respond effectively to security incidents. IMTTR does not measure the frequency or impact of an \nevent, but rather the capability and readiness of the team. RTO is a metric that defines the maximum acceptable time for \nrestoring a system or service after a disruption. RTO does not measure the frequency or impact of an event, but rather the \navailability and continuity of the system or service. MTBF is a metric that measures the average time between failures of a \nsystem or component.

      "explanation": "A web filter is a device or software that can monitor, block, or allow web traffic based on predefined rules or policies. One of \nthe common methods of web filtering is to scan the URL for strings and deny access when matches are found. For example, \na web filter can block access to websites that contain the words ?gambling?, ?porn?, or ?malware? in their URLs. A URL is a \nuniform resource locator that identifies the location and protocol of a web resource. A URL typically consists of the following \ncomponents: protocol://domain:port/path?query#fragment. The protocol specifies the \ncommunication method used to access the web resource, such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, or SMTP. The domain is the name \nof the web server that hosts the web resource, such as www.google.com or www.bing.com. The port is an optional number \nthat identifies the specific service or application running on the web server, such as 80 for HTTP or 443 for HTTPS. The path \nis the specific folder or file name of the web resource, such as /index.html or /images/logo.png. The query is an optional \nstring \nthat contains additional information or parameters for the web resource, such as ?q=security or ?lang=en. The fragment is \nan optional string that identifies a specific part or section of the web resource, such as #introduction or #summary. \nTo prohibit access to non-encrypted websites, an analyst should employ a search string that matches the protocol of non-\nencrypted web traffic, which is HTTP. HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol, and it is a standard protocol for \ntransferring data between web servers and web browsers. However, HTTP does not provide any encryption or security for \nthe data, which means that anyone who intercepts the web traffic can read or modify the data. Therefore, non-encrypted \nwebsites are vulnerable to eavesdropping, tampering, or spoofing attacks. To access a non-encrypted website, the URL \nusually starts with http://, followed by the domain name and optionally the port number. For example, \nhttp://www.example.com or http://www.example.com:80. By scanning the URL for the string http://, the web filter can identify \nand block non-encrypted websites. \nThe other options are not correct because they do not match the protocol of non-encrypted web traffic. Encryption=off is a \npossible query string that indicates the encryption status of the web resource, but it is not a standard or mandatory \nparameter. Https:// is the protocol of encrypted web traffic, which uses hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) to provide \nencryption and security for the data. Www.*.com is a possible domain name that matches any website that starts with www \nand ends with .com, but it does not specify the protocol. :443 is the port number of HTTPS, which is the protocol of \nencrypted web traffic.

SSO is commonly used for accessing SaaS \napplications, such as Office 365, Google Workspace, Salesforce, and others, using domain credentials123. \nB) LEAP stands for Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol, which is a Cisco proprietary protocol that provides \nauthentication for wireless networks. LEAP is not related to SaaS applications or domain credentials4. \nC) MFA stands for multi-factor authentication, which is a method of authentication that requires users to provide two or more \npieces of evidence to prove their identity. MFA can enhance security by adding an extra layer of protection beyond \npasswords, such as tokens, biometrics, or codes. MFA is not related to SaaS applications or domain credentials, but it can \nbe used in conjunction with SSO. \n\n\nD) PEAP stands for Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol, which is a protocol that provides secure authentication for \nwireless networks. PEAP uses TLS to create an encrypted tunnel between the client and the server, and then uses another \nauthentication method, such as MS-CHAPv2 or EAPGTC, to verify the user?s identity. PEAP is not related to SaaS \napplications or domain credentials. \nReference = 1: Security+ (SY0-701) Certification Study Guide | CompTIA IT Certifications 2: What is \nSingle Sign-On (SSO)? - Definition from WhatIs.com 3: Single sign-on - Wikipedia 4: Lightweight \nExtensible Authentication Protocol - Wikipedia : What is Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)? - \nDefinition from WhatIs.com : Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol - Wikipedia",

The AUP helps companies minimize their exposure to cyber security threats and limit other risks. The AUP also \nserves as a notice to users about what they are not allowed to do and protects the company against misuse of their network. \nUsers usually have to acknowledge that they understand and agree to the rules before accessing the network1. \nAn AUP best represents a preventive security control type, because it aims to deter or stop potential security incidents from \noccurring in the first place. A preventive control is proactive and anticipates possible threats and vulnerabilities, and \nimplements measures to prevent them from exploiting or harming the system or the data. A preventive control can be \nphysical, technical, or administrative in nature2. \nSome examples of preventive controls are: \nLocks, fences, or guards that prevent unauthorized physical access to a facility or a device \nFirewalls, antivirus software, or encryption that prevent unauthorized logical access to a network or a system \nPolicies, procedures, or training that prevent unauthorized or inappropriate actions or behaviors by users or employees \n\n\nAn AUP is an example of an administrative preventive control, because it defines the policies and procedures that users \nmust follow to ensure the security and proper use of the network and the IT resources. An AUP can prevent users from \nengaging in activities that could compromise the security, performance, or availability of the network or the system, such as: \nDownloading or installing unauthorized or malicious software \nAccessing or sharing sensitive or confidential information without authorization or encryption \nUsing the network or the system for personal, illegal, or unethical purposes \nBypassing or disabling security controls or mechanisms \nConnecting unsecured or unapproved devices to the network \nBy enforcing an AUP, a company can prevent or reduce the likelihood of security breaches, data loss, legal liability, or \nreputational damage caused by user actions or inactions3. \nReference = 1: How to Create an Acceptable Use Policy - CoreTech, 2: [Security Control Types: \nPreventive, Detective, Corrective, and Compensating], 3: Why You Need A Corporate Acceptable Use Policy - CompTIA",

      "explanation": "PCI DSS is the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which is a set of security requirements for organizations that \nstore, process, or transmit cardholder data. PCI DSS aims to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of \ncardholder data and prevent fraud, identity theft, and data breaches. PCI DSS is enforced by the payment card brands, such \nas Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, and JCB, and applies to all entities involved in the payment card \necosystem, such as merchants, acquirers, issuers, processors, service providers, and payment applications. \nIf a large bank fails an internal PCI DSS compliance assessment, the most likely outcome is that the bank will face fines from \nthe payment card brands. An internal PCI DSS compliance assessment is a self-assessment that the bank performs to \nevaluate its own compliance with the PCI DSS requirements. The bank must submit the results of the internal assessment to \nthe payment card brands or their designated agents, such as acquirers or qualified security assessors (QSAs). If the internal \nassessment reveals that the bank is not compliant with the PCI DSS requirements, the payment card brands may impose \nfines on the bank as a penalty for violating the PCI DSS contract. \nThe amount and frequency of the fines may vary depending on the severity and duration of the noncompliance, the number \nand type of cardholder data compromised, and the level of cooperation and remediation from the bank. The fines can range \nfrom thousands to millions of dollars per month, and can increase over time if the non-compliance is not resolved. \nThe other options are not correct because they are not the most likely outcomes if a large bank fails an internal PCI DSS \ncompliance assessment.\nB.

      "explanation": "A bastion host is a special-purpose server that is designed to withstand attacks and provide secure access to internal \nresources. A bastion host is usually placed on the edge of a network, acting as a gateway or proxy to the internal network. A \nbastion host can be configured to allow only certain types of traffic, such as SSH or HTTP, and block all other traffic. A \nbastion host can also run security software such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and antivirus programs to monitor \nand filter incoming and outgoing traffic. A bastion host can provide administrative access to internal resources by requiring \nstrong authentication and encryption, and by logging all activities for auditing purposes12. \n\n\nA bastion host is the most secure method among the given options because it minimizes the traffic allowed through the \nsecurity boundary and provides a single point of control and defense. A bastion host can also isolate the internal network \nfrom direct exposure to the internet or other untrusted networks, reducing the attack surface and the risk of compromise3. \nDeploying a perimeter network is not the correct answer, because a perimeter network is a network segment that separates \nthe internal network from the external network. A perimeter network usually hosts public-facing services such as web \nservers, email servers, or DNS servers that need to be accessible from the internet. A perimeter network does not provide \nadministrative access to internal resources, but rather protects them from unauthorized access. A perimeter network can \nalso increase the complexity and cost of network management and security4. \nInstalling a WAF is not the correct answer, because a WAF is a security tool that protects web applications from common \nweb-based attacks by monitoring, filtering, and blocking HTTP traffic. A \nWAF can prevent attacks such as cross-site scripting, SQL injection, or file inclusion, among others. A WAF does not provide \nadministrative access to internal resources, but rather protects them from web application vulnerabilities. A WAF is also not a \ncomprehensive solution for network security, as it only operates at the application layer and does not protect against other \ntypes of attacks or threats5. \nUtilizing single sign-on is not the correct answer, because single sign-on is a method of authentication that allows users to \naccess multiple sites, services, or applications with one username and password. Single sign-on can simplify the sign-in \nprocess for users and reduce the number of passwords they have to remember and manage. Single sign-on does not \nprovide administrative access to internal resources, but rather enables access to various resources that the user is \nauthorized to use. Single sign-on can also introduce security risks if the user?s credentials are compromised or if the single \nsign-on provider is breached6.

Therefore, implementing Zero Trust principles \nwithin the data plane can help to improve the security and resilience of the network. \nOne of the key principles of Zero Trust is to assume breach and minimize the blast radius and segment access.

      "explanation": "Full disk encryption (FDE) is a technique that encrypts all the data on a hard drive, including the operating system, \napplications, and files. FDE protects the data from unauthorized access in case the laptop is lost, stolen, or disposed of \nwithout proper sanitization. FDE requires the user to enter a password, a PIN, a smart card, or a biometric factor to unlock \nthe drive and boot the system. FDE can be implemented by using software solutions, such as BitLocker, FileVault, or \nVeraCrypt, or by using hardware solutions, such as self-encrypting drives (SEDs) or Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs). FDE \nis a recommended encryption technique for laptops and other mobile devices that store sensitive data. Partition encryption is \na technique that encrypts only a specific partition or volume on a hard drive, leaving the rest of the drive unencrypted. \nPartition encryption is less secure than FDE, as it does not protect the entire drive and may leave traces of data on \nunencrypted areas. Partition encryption is also less convenient than FDE, as it requires the user to mount and unmount the \nencrypted partition manually. \nAsymmetric encryption is a technique that uses a pair of keys, one public and one private, to encrypt and decrypt data. \nAsymmetric encryption is mainly used for securing communication, such as email, web, or VPN, rather than for encrypting \ndata at rest. Asymmetric encryption is also slower and more computationally intensive than symmetric encryption, which is \nthe type of encryption used by FDE and partition encryption. \nDatabase encryption is a technique that encrypts data stored in a database, such as tables, columns, rows, or cells. \nDatabase encryption can be done at the application level, the database level, or the file system level. Database encryption is \nuseful for protecting data from unauthorized access by database administrators, hackers, or malware, but it does not protect \nthe data from physical theft or loss of the device that hosts the database. \n\n\nReference = Data Encryption ?

      "explanation": "A change management procedure is a set of steps and guidelines that a security administrator should adhere to when \nsetting up a new set of firewall rules. A firewall is a device or software that can filter, block, or allow network traffic based on \npredefined rules or policies. A firewall rule is a statement that defines the criteria and action for a firewall to apply to a packet \nor a connection. For example, a firewall rule can allow or deny traffic based on the source and destination IP addresses, \nports, protocols, or applications. Setting up a new set of firewall rules is a type of change that can affect the \nsecurity, performance, and functionality of the network. Therefore, a change management procedure is necessary to ensure \nthat the change is planned, tested, approved, implemented, documented, and reviewed in a controlled and consistent \nmanner. A change management procedure typically includes the following elements: \nA change request that describes the purpose, scope, impact, and benefits of the change, as well as the roles and \nresponsibilities of the change owner, implementer, and approver. \nA change assessment that evaluates the feasibility, risks, costs, and dependencies of the change, as well as the alternatives \nand contingency plans. \nA change approval that authorizes the change to proceed to the implementation stage, based on the criteria and thresholds \ndefined by the change policy. \nA change implementation that executes the change according to the plan and schedule, and verifies the results and \noutcomes of the change. \nA change documentation that records the details and status of the change, as well as the lessons learned and best \npractices. \nA change review that monitors and measures the performance and effectiveness of the change, and identifies any issues or \ngaps that need to be addressed or improved. \n\n\nA change management procedure is important for a security administrator to adhere to when setting up a new set of firewall \nrules, as it can help to achieve the following objectives: \nEnhance the security posture and compliance of the network by ensuring that the firewall rules are aligned with the security \npolicies and standards, and that they do not introduce any vulnerabilities or conflicts. \nMinimize the disruption and downtime of the network by ensuring that the firewall rules are tested and validated before \ndeployment, and that they do not affect the availability or functionality of the network services or applications. \nImprove the efficiency and quality of the network by ensuring that the firewall rules are optimized and updated according to \nthe changing needs and demands of the network users and stakeholders, and that they do not cause any performance or \ncompatibility issues. \nIncrease the accountability and transparency of the network by ensuring that the firewall rules are documented and reviewed \nregularly, and that they are traceable and auditable by the relevant authorities and parties. \nThe other options are not correct because they are not related to the process of setting up a new set of firewall rules. A \ndisaster recovery plan is a set of policies and procedures that aim to restore the normal operations of an organization in the \nevent of a system failure, natural disaster, or other emergency. An incident response procedure is a set of steps and \nguidelines that aim to contain, analyze, eradicate, and recover from a security incident, such as a cyberattack, data breach, \nor malware infection.

      "explanation": "After completing a vulnerability assessment and remediating the identified vulnerabilities, the next step is to rescan the \nnetwork to verify that the vulnerabilities have been successfully fixed and no new vulnerabilities have been introduced. A \nvulnerability assessment is a process of identifying and evaluating the weaknesses and exposures in a network, system, or \napplication that could be exploited by attackers. A vulnerability assessment typically involves using automated tools, such as \nscanners, to scan the network and generate a report of the findings. The report may include information such as the severity, \nimpact, and remediation of the vulnerabilities. The operations team is responsible for applying the appropriate patches, \nupdates, or configurations to address the vulnerabilities and reduce the risk to the network. A rescan is necessary to confirm \nthat the remediation actions have been effective and that the network is secure. \nConducting an audit, initiating a penetration test, or submitting a report are not the next steps after completing a vulnerability \nassessment and remediating the vulnerabilities. An audit is a process of reviewing and verifying the compliance of the \nnetwork with the established policies, standards, and regulations. An audit may be performed by internal or external auditors, \n\n\nand it may use the results of the vulnerability assessment as part of the evidence. However, an audit is not a mandatory step \nafter a vulnerability assessment, and it does not validate the effectiveness of the remediation actions. A penetration test is a \nprocess of simulating a real-world attack on the network to test the security defenses and identify any gaps or weaknesses. \nA penetration test may use the results of the vulnerability assessment as a starting point, but it goes beyond scanning and \ninvolves exploiting the vulnerabilities to gain access or cause damage. A penetration test may be performed after a \nvulnerability assessment, but only with the proper authorization, scope, and rules of engagement. A penetration test is not a \nsubstitute for a rescan, as it does not verify that the vulnerabilities have been fixed. \nSubmitting a report is a step that is done after the vulnerability assessment, but before the remediation. The report is a \ndocument that summarizes the findings and recommendations of the vulnerability assessment, and it is used to \ncommunicate the results to the stakeholders and the operations team.

However, hardening a legacy server is not a permanent \nsolution, and it may not be sufficient to address all the security issues and challenges posed by the outdated or unsupported \nsystem. Therefore, it is advisable to plan for the eventual decommissioning or migration of the legacy server to a more \nsecure and modern platform, as soon as possible. \nReference: CompTIA Security+ SY0-701 Certification Study Guide, Chapter 3: Architecture and \nDesign, Section 3.2: Secure System Design, Page 133 1; CompTIA Security+ Certification Exam Objectives, Domain 3: \nArchitecture and Design, Objective 3.2: Explain the importance of secure system design, Subobjective: Legacy systems 2",

Web-based administration can be exploited by \nattackers to gain unauthorized access to the router?s settings, firmware, or data, or to launch attacks such as cross-site \nscripting (XSS) or cross-site request forgery (CSRF). Therefore, disabling web-based administration is a good practice to \nharden the routers within the corporate network. Console access, routing protocols, and VLANs are other features that can \nbe configured on routers, but they are not the most appropriate to disable for hardening purposes. Console access is a \nphysical connection to the router that requires direct access to the device, which can be secured by locking the router in a \ncabinet or using a strong password. Routing protocols are essential for routers to exchange routing information and maintain \nnetwork connectivity, and they can be secured by using authentication or encryption mechanisms. VLANs are logical \nsegments of a network that can enhance network performance and security by isolating traffic and devices, and they can be \nsecured by using VLAN access control lists \n(VACLs) or private VLANs (PVLANs).

Automation can help to improve the efficiency, accuracy, and consistency of security \noperations, as well as reduce human errors and costs. Automation can be used to monitor, audit, and enforce security \nsettings on servers, such as firewall rules, encryption keys, access controls, patch levels, and configuration files. Automation \ncan also alert security personnel of any changes or anomalies that may indicate a security breach or compromise12. \nThe other options are not the best ways to consistently determine on a daily basis whether security settings on servers have \nbeen modified: \nCompliance checklist: This is a document that lists the security requirements, standards, or best practices that an \norganization must follow or adhere to. A compliance checklist can help to ensure that the security settings on servers are \naligned with the organizational policies and regulations, but it does not automatically detect or report any changes or \nmodifications that may occur on a daily basis3. \nAttestation: This is a process of verifying or confirming the validity or accuracy of a statement, claim, or fact. Attestation can \nbe used to provide assurance or evidence that the security settings on servers are correct and authorized, but it does not \ncontinuously monitor or audit any changes or modifications that may occur on a daily basis4. \n\n\nManual audit: This is a process of examining or reviewing the security settings on servers by human inspectors or auditors.

      "explanation": "Encryption at rest is a strategy that protects data stored on a device, such as a laptop, by converting it into an unreadable \nformat that can only be accessed with a decryption key or password. Encryption at rest can prevent data loss on stolen \nlaptops by preventing unauthorized access to the data, even if the device is physically compromised. Encryption at rest can \nalso help comply with data privacy regulations and standards that require data protection. Masking, data classification, and \npermission restrictions are other strategies that can help protect data, but they may not be sufficient or applicable for data \n\n\nstored on laptops. Masking is a technique that obscures sensitive data elements, such as credit card numbers, with random \ncharacters or symbols, but it is usually used for data in transit or in use, not at rest. Data classification is a process that \nassigns labels to data based on its sensitivity and business impact, but it does not protect the data itself. Permission \nrestrictions are rules that define who can access, modify, or delete data, but they may not prevent unauthorized access if the \nlaptop is stolen and the security controls are bypassed.

A serverless framework is a type of cloud computing service that allows developers to run applications without \nmanaging or provisioning any servers. The cloud provider handles the server-side infrastructure, such as scaling, load \nbalancing, security, and maintenance, and charges the developer only for the resources consumed by the application. A \nserverless framework enables developers to focus on the application logic and functionality, and reduces the operational \ncosts and complexity of hosting applications. Some examples of serverless frameworks are AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, \nand Google Cloud Functions. \nA type 1 hypervisor, SD-WAN, and SDN are not cloud-based application-hosting solutions that meet the requirements of low-\ncost and cloud-based. A type 1 hypervisor is a software layer that runs directly on the hardware and creates multiple virtual \nmachines that can run different operating systems and applications. A type 1 hypervisor is not a cloud-based service, but a \nvirtualization technology that can be used to create private or hybrid clouds. A type 1 hypervisor also requires the developer \nto manage and provision the servers and the virtual machines, which can increase the operational costs and complexity of \nhosting applications.

      "explanation": "A firewall policy is a set of rules that defines what traffic is allowed or denied on a network. A firewall policy should be \ncarefully designed and tested before being implemented, as a misconfigured policy can cause network disruptions or \nsecurity breaches. A common best practice is to test the policy in a non-production environment, such as a lab or a \nsimulation, before enabling the policy in the production network. This way, the technician can verify the functionality and \nperformance of the policy, and identify and resolve any issues or conflicts, without affecting the live network. Testing the \npolicy in a non-production environment would prevent the issue of the ?deny any? policy causing several company servers \nto become unreachable, as the technician would be able to detect and correct the problem before applying the policy to the \nproduction network. \n\n\nDocumenting the new policy in a change request and submitting the request to change management is a good practice, but \nit would not prevent the issue by itself. Change management is a process that ensures that any changes to the network are \nauthorized, documented, and communicated, but it does not guarantee that the changes are error-free or functional. The \ntechnician still needs to test the policy before implementing it. \nDisabling any intrusion prevention signatures on the ?deny any? policy prior to enabling the new policy would not prevent the \nissue, and it could reduce the security of the network. Intrusion prevention signatures are patterns that identify malicious or \nunwanted traffic, and allow the firewall to block or alert on such traffic. Disabling these signatures would make the firewall \nless effective in detecting and preventing attacks, and it would not affect the reachability of the company servers. Including \nan ?allow any? policy above the ?deny any? policy would not prevent the issue, and it would render the ?deny any? policy \nuseless. A firewall policy is processed from top to bottom, and the first matching rule is applied. An ?allow any? policy would \nmatch any traffic and allow it to pass through the firewall, regardless of the source, destination, or protocol. This would \nnegate the purpose of the ?deny any? policy, which is to block any traffic that does not match any of the previous rules. \nMoreover, an ?allow any? policy would create a security risk, as it would allow any unauthorized or malicious traffic to enter \nor exit the network.

      "explanation": "The principle of least privilege is a security concept that limits access to resources to the minimum level needed for a user, a \nprogram, or a device to perform a legitimate function. It is a cybersecurity best practice that protects high-value data and \nassets from compromise or insider threat. Least privilege can be applied to different abstraction layers of a computing \nenvironment, such as processes, systems, or connected devices. However, it is rarely implemented in practice. \nIn this scenario, the IT manager is setting up the principle of least privilege by restricting access to the administrator console \nof the help desk software to only two authorized users: the IT manager and the help desk lead. This way, the IT manager \ncan prevent unauthorized or accidental changes to the software configuration, data, or functionality by other help desk staff. \nThe other help desk staff will only have access to the normal user interface of the software, which is sufficient for them to \nperform their job functions. \nThe other options are not correct. Hardening is the process of securing a system by reducing its surface of vulnerability, such \nas by removing unnecessary software, changing default passwords, or disabling unnecessary services. Employee \nmonitoring is the surveillance of workers? activity, such as by tracking web browsing, application use, keystrokes, or \nscreenshots. Configuration enforcement is the process of ensuring that a system adheres to a predefined set of security \nsettings, such as by applying a patch, a policy, or a template.

      "explanation": "Password spraying is a type of brute force attack that tries common passwords across several accounts to find a match. It is \na mass trial-and-error approach that can bypass account lockout protocols. It can give hackers access to personal or \nbusiness accounts and information. It is not a targeted attack, but a high-volume attack tactic that uses a dictionary or a list \nof popular or weak passwords12. \nThe logs show that the attacker is using the same password (\"password123\") to attempt to log in to different accounts \n(\"admin\", \"user1\", \"user2\", etc.) on the same web server. This is a typical pattern of password spraying, as the attacker is \nhoping that at least one of the accounts has a weak password that matches the one they are trying. The attacker is also \n\n\nusing a tool called Hydra, which is one of the most popular brute force tools, often used in cracking passwords for network \nauthentication3. Account forgery is not the correct answer, because it involves creating fake accounts or credentials to \nimpersonate legitimate users or entities. There is no evidence of account forgery in the logs, as the attacker is not creating \nany new accounts or using forged credentials. \nPass-the-hash is not the correct answer, because it involves stealing a hashed user credential and using it to create a new \nauthenticated session on the same network. Pass-the-hash does not require the attacker to know or crack the password, as \nthey use the stored version of the password to initiate a new session4. The logs show that the attacker is using plain text \npasswords, not hashes, to try to log in to the web server. \nBrute-force is not the correct answer, because it is a broader term that encompasses different types of attacks that involve \ntrying different variations of symbols or words until the correct password is found. Password spraying is a specific type of \nbrute force attack that uses a single common password against multiple accounts5. The logs show that the attacker is using \npassword spraying, not brute force in general, to try to gain access to the web server.

Input validation can prevent various types of attacks, such as injection, cross-site scripting, buffer \noverflow, and command execution, that exploit the vulnerabilities in the application code. Input validation can be performed \non both the client-side and the server-side, using methods such as whitelisting, blacklisting, filtering, sanitizing, escaping, \nand encoding. By including regular expressions in the source code to remove special characters from the variables set by \nthe forms in the web application, the organization adopted input validation as a security technique. Regular expressions are \npatterns that match a specific set of characters or strings, and can be used to filter out any unwanted or harmful input. \nSpecial characters, such as $, |, ;, &, `, and ?, can be used by attackers to inject commands or scripts into the application, \nand cause damage or data theft. By removing these characters from the input, the organization can reduce the risk of such \nattacks. \n\n\nIdentify embedded keys, code debugging, and static code analysis are not the security techniques that the organization \nadopted by making this addition to the policy.

Cyber insurance can help a company recover from the \ncosts of restoring data, repairing systems, paying ransoms, compensating customers, or facing legal actions. Cyber \ninsurance is one of the possible strategies that a company can use to address the items listed on the risk register. A risk \nregister is a document that records the identified risks, their probability, impact, and mitigation strategies for a project or an \norganization. The four common risk mitigation strategies are: \nAccept: The company acknowledges the risk and decides to accept the consequences without taking any action to reduce or \neliminate the risk. This strategy is usually chosen when the risk is low or the cost of mitigation is too high. \nTransfer: The company transfers the risk to a third party, such as an insurance company, a vendor, or a partner. This \nstrategy is usually chosen when the risk is high or the company lacks the resources or expertise to handle the risk. \nMitigate: The company implements controls or measures to reduce the likelihood or impact of the risk. This strategy is \nusually chosen when the risk is moderate or the cost of mitigation is reasonable. Avoid: The company eliminates the risk by \nchanging the scope, plan, or design of the project or the organization. This strategy is usually chosen when the risk is \nunacceptable or the cost of mitigation is too high. \nBy purchasing cyber insurance, the company is transferring the risk to the insurance company, which will cover the financial \nlosses and liabilities in case of a cyberattack.

Which of the following should the analyst do?",
      "options": [
        "Place posters around the office to raise awareness of common phishing activities.",

      "explanation": "An endpoint detection and response (EDR) system is a security tool that monitors and analyzes the activities and behaviors \nof endpoints, such as computers, laptops, mobile devices, and servers. An EDR system can detect, prevent, and respond to \nvarious types of threats, such as malware, ransomware, phishing, and advanced persistent threats (APTs). One of the \nfeatures of an EDR system is to block the automatic execution of downloaded programs, which can prevent malicious code \nfrom running on the endpoint when a user clicks on a link in a phishing message. This can reduce the impact of a phishing \nattack and protect the endpoint from compromise. Updating the EDR policies to block automatic execution of downloaded \nprograms is a technical control that can mitigate the risk of phishing, regardless of the user?s awareness or behavior. \nTherefore, this is the best answer among the given options. \nThe other options are not as effective as updating the EDR policies, because they rely on \nadministrative or physical controls that may not be sufficient to prevent or stop a phishing attack. Placing posters around the \noffice to raise awareness of common phishing activities is a physical control that can increase the user?s knowledge of \nphishing, but it may not change their behavior or prevent them from clicking on a link in a phishing message. Implementing \nemail security filters to prevent phishing emails from being delivered is an administrative control that can reduce the \nexposure to phishing, but it may not be able to block all phishing emails, especially if they are crafted to bypass the filters. \nCreating additional training for users to recognize the signs of phishing attempts is an administrative control that can improve \nthe user?s skills of phishing detection, but it may not guarantee that they will always be vigilant or cautious when receiving \nan email. Therefore, these options are not the best answer for this question. Reference = Endpoint Detection and Response \n?

      "explanation": "A firewall rule is a set of criteria that determines whether to allow or deny a packet to pass through the firewall. A firewall rule \nconsists of several elements, such as the action, the protocol, the source address, the destination address, and the port \nnumber. The syntax of a firewall rule may vary depending on the type and vendor of the firewall, but the basic logic is the \nsame. In this question, the security analyst is creating an inbound firewall rule to block the IP address 10.1.4.9 from \naccessing the organization?s network. This means that the action should be deny, the protocol should be any (or ig for IP), \nthe source address should be 10.1.4.9 (which means a single IP address), the destination address should be 0.0.0.0/0 \n(which means any IP address), and the port number should be any. Therefore, the correct firewall rule is: \naccess-list inbound deny ig source 10.1.4.9 destination 0.0.0.0/0 \nThis rule will match any packet that has the source IP address of 10.1.4.9 and drop it. The other options are incorrect \nbecause they either have the wrong action, the wrong source address, or the wrong destination address. For example, \noption A has the source and destination addresses reversed, which means that it will block any packet that has the \ndestination IP address of 10.1.4.9, which is not the intended goal. Option C has the wrong action, which is permit, which \nmeans that it will allow the packet to pass through the firewall, which is also not the intended goal. Option D has the same \nproblem as option A, with the source and destination addresses reversed. \nReference = Firewall Rules ? CompTIA Security+ SY0-401: 1.2, Firewalls ?

Geographic dispersion can help the company to mitigate the risk of weather events causing damage to the server \nroom and downtime, as well as improve the availability, performance, and resilience of the network. Geographic dispersion \n\n\ncan also enhance the disaster recovery and business continuity capabilities of the company, as it can provide backup and \nfailover options in case of a regional outage or disruption12. \nThe other options are not the best ways to address the company?s concern: \nClustering servers: This is a technique that involves grouping multiple servers together to act as a single system. Clustering \nservers can help to improve the performance, scalability, and fault tolerance of the network, but it does not protect the \nservers from physical damage or downtime caused by weather events, especially if the servers are located in the same room \nor building3. Load balancers: These are devices or software that distribute the network traffic or workload among multiple \nservers or resources. Load balancers can help to optimize the utilization, efficiency, and reliability of the network, but they do \nnot prevent the servers from being damaged or disrupted by weather events, especially if the servers are located in the \nsame room or building4. \nOff-site backups: These are copies of data or files that are stored in a different location than the original source. Off-site \nbackups can help to protect the data from being lost or corrupted by weather events, but they do not prevent the servers \nfrom being damaged or disrupted by weather events, nor do they ensure the availability or continuity of the network services. \nReference = 1: CompTIA Security+ SY0-701 Certification Study Guide, page 972: High Availability ? \nCompTIA Security+ SY0-701 ? 3.4, video by Professor Messer3: CompTIA Security+ SY0-701 \nCertification Study Guide, page 984: CompTIA Security+ SY0-701 Certification Study Guide, page 99. : CompTIA Security+ \nSY0-701 Certification Study Guide, page 100.",

Two of these benefits are: \nA) If a security incident occurs on the device, the correct employee can be notified. An asset inventory sticker is a label that \ncontains a unique identifier for a laptop, such as a serial number, a barcode, or a QR code. By associating this identifier with \nan employee ID, the security team can easily track and locate the owner of the laptop in case of a security incident, such as \na malware infection, a data breach, or a theft. This way, the security team can notify the correct employee about the incident, \nand provide them with the necessary instructions or actions to take, such as changing passwords, scanning for viruses, or \nreporting the loss. This can help to contain the incident, minimize the damage, and prevent further escalation. \nF) Company data can be accounted for when the employee leaves the organization.
