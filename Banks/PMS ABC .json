Passive reconnaissance\r\nPassive reconnaissance focuses on gathering as much information from\r\nopen sources such as social media, corporate websites, and business\r\norganizations.\r\nThe incorrect answers:\r\nA. Vulnerability scanning\r\nSome active reconnaissance tests will query systems directly to see if a\r\nvulnerability currently exists.\r\nC. Supply chain analysis\r\nA supply chain analysis will examine the security associated with a\r\nsupplier, and the analysis will not provide any information regarding a\r\ncompany's own servers and data.\r\nD. Regulatory audit\r\nA regulatory audit is a detailed security analysis based on existing laws or\r\nprivate guidelines. A regulatory audit commonly requires access to internal\r\nsystems and data.",

The legitimate\r\nowner of the originating email domain can choose to have these messages\r\naccepted, sent to a spam folder, or rejected.\r\nThe incorrect answers:\r\nA. SPF\r\nSPF (Sender Policy Framework) is a list of all authorized mail servers for\r\na specific domain. All legitimate emails would be sent from one of the\r\nservers listed in the SPF configuration.\r\nB. NAC\r\nNAC (Network Access Control) is a way to limit network access to only\r\nauthorized users.

E-discovery\r\nE-discovery relates to the collection, preparation, review, interpretation,\r\nand production of electronic documents. E-discovery itself is not involved\r\nwith the research and determination of an attack's root cause.\r\nC.

This can be\r\nespecially useful to provide alerts when a configuration change causes an\r\norganization to be out of compliance.\r\nThe incorrect answers:\r\nA. Maintenance window\r\nA maintenance window describes the scheduling associated with the\r\nchange control process. Systems and services generally have limited\r\navailability during a maintenance window.\r\nB. Attestation and acknowledgment\r\nWith compliance, the process of attestation and acknowledgment is the\r\nfinal verification of the formal compliance documentation. An alert from\r\nan automated process would not qualify as attestation.\r\nD.

Create an operating system security policy to prevent\r\nthe use of removable media\r\nRemovable media uses hot-pluggable interfaces such as USB to connect\r\nstorage drives. A security policy in the operating system can prevent any\r\nfiles from being written to a removable drive.\r\nThe incorrect answers:\r\nB. Monitor removable media usage in host-based firewall logs\r\nA host-based firewall monitors traffic flows and does not commonly log\r\nhardware or USB drive access.\r\nC. Only allow applications that do not use removable media\r\nFile storage access options are not associated with applications, so it’s not\r\npossible to allow based on external storage drive usage.\r\nD. Define a removable media block rule in the UTM\r\nA UTM (Unified Threat Manager) watches traffic flows across the\r\nnetwork and does not commonly manage the storage options on individual\r\ncomputers.",

Data in use\r\nData in use describes information actively processing in the memory of a\r\nsystem, such as system RAM, CPU registers, or CPU cache. Government\r\nreports are static documents and are not actively being processed.\r\nB. Obfuscated\r\nObfuscation describes the modification of data to make something\r\nunderstandable into something very difficult to understand. Information\r\ncontained in a government report is relatively easy to understand and\r\nwould not be considered obfuscated data.\r\nC.

Enable time-of-day restrictions on\r\nthe authentication server\r\nAdding location-based policies will prevent direct data access from outside\r\nof the country. Saving log information from all devices and creating audit\r\nreports from a single database can be implemented through the use of a\r\nSIEM (Security Information and Event Manager). Adding a check for the\r\ntime-of-day will report any access that occurs during non-working hours.\r\n\r\nThe incorrect answers:\r\nB. Require government-issued identification during the\r\nonboarding process\r\nRequiring proper identification is always a good idea, but it’s not one of\r\nthe listed requirements.\r\nC. Add additional password complexity for accounts that access data\r\nAdditional password complexity is another good best practice, but it’s not\r\npart of the provided requirements.\r\nD. Conduct monthly permission auditing\r\nNo requirements for ongoing auditing were included in the requirements,\r\nbut ongoing auditing is always an important consideration.\r\nF. Archive the encryption keys of all disabled accounts\r\nIf an account is disabled, there may still be encrypted data that needs to be\r\nrecovered later. Archiving the encryption keys will allow access to that data\r\nafter the account is no longer in use.",

A download was blocked from a web server\r\nA traffic flow from a web server port number (80) to a device port (60818)\r\nindicates that this traffic flow originated on port 80 of the web server. A\r\nfile download is one of the most common ways to deliver a Trojan, and\r\nthis log entry shows that the file containing the XPACK.A_7854 Trojan\r\nwas blocked.\r\nThe incorrect answers:\r\nA. The victim’s IP address is 136.127.92.171\r\nThe format for this log entry uses an arrow to differentiate between the\r\nattacker and the victim. The attacker IP address is 136.127.92.171, and the\r\nvictim’s IP address is 10.16.10.14.\r\nC. A botnet DDoS attack was blocked\r\nA botnet attack would not commonly include a Trojan horse as part of a\r\ndistributed denial of service (DDoS) attack.\r\nD.

Brute force\r\nA brute force attack is commonly associated with password hacks. Brute\r\nforce attacks would not cause the certificate on a website to be invalid.\r\nB.

In this example,\r\na daily backup would ensure tax information is constantly archived over\r\na seven year period and could always be retrieved if needed.

For example, some\r\nfinancial information may need to be retained well beyond the seven year\r\nmandate.\r\nB.

If the password isn't discovered in\r\nthose few attempts, the brute force process stops before any account\r\nlockouts occur. An attacker could potentially perform a spraying attack\r\nacross many accounts without any noticeable alerts or alarms.\r\nThe incorrect answers:\r\nA. Downgrade attack\r\nA downgrade attack takes advantage of a cryptographic weakness or\r\nvulnerability to gain access. This weakness is often due to an unpatched\r\napplication or a poorly implemented cryptographic process. In this\r\nexample, the attack is focused on a small number of brute force attempts\r\nand not on a cryptographic issue.\r\nB. Phishing\r\nPhishing is a useful attack for gathering information. Since a phishing\r\nattack often gathers valid authentication details, it's not necessary for the\r\nphishing process to also perform a brute force attack.\r\nC. Injection\r\nAn injection attack adds additional information to a data stream in an\r\nattempt to access systems or data which would normally not be accessible.\r\nAn injection attack does not generally perform a brute force attack.",

Add a content filter rule\r\nWeb filters contain a large database of categorized website addresses, and\r\nthis allows an administrator to create rules to block browsing attempts to\r\nspecific content. For example, a content filter may allow browsing to news\r\nand business sites, but block browsing attempts to gaming and shopping\r\nsites.\r\nThe incorrect answers:\r\nA. Tune the IPS signatures\r\nAn IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) can identify and block known\r\nexploits within network traffic. An IPS does not maintain a categorized\r\nlist of websites, and tuning the IPS signatures would not block specific\r\nwebsite categories.\r\nB. Block port tcp/443 on the firewall\r\nBlocking a single port would not provide filtering on a specific website\r\ncategory.
