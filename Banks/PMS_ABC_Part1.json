Passive reconnaissance\r\nPassive reconnaissance focuses on gathering as much information from\r\nopen sources such as social media, corporate websites, and business\r\norganizations.\r\nThe incorrect answers:\r\nA. Vulnerability scanning\r\nSome active reconnaissance tests will query systems directly to see if a\r\nvulnerability currently exists.\r\nC.

Containerization\r\nContainerization is an application deployment architecture that uses\r\na self-contained group of application code and dependencies. Using\r\ncontainerization, many separate containers can be deployed simultaneously\r\non a single system.\r\nB. Jailbreaking\r\nJailbreaking describes the replacement of firmware on a mobile phone\r\nor tablet with the goal of enabling or allowing features that would not\r\nnormally be available. For example, a jailbroken phone or tablet can install\r\nsoftware from locations other than the primary app store.\r\nC. SDN\r\nSDN (Software-Defined Networking) separates the control plane of\r\ndevices from the data plane. This allows for more automation and dynamic\r\nchanges to the infrastructure.",

      "explanation": "The Answer: D. DNS poisoning\r\nAn attacker with access to a DNS (Domain Name System) server can\r\nmodify the DNS configuration files and redirect users to a different\r\nwebsite. Anyone using a different DNS server may not see any problems\r\nwith connectivity to the original site.\r\nThe incorrect answers:\r\nA. Buffer overflow\r\nA buffer overflow vulnerability is associated with application input\r\nthat exceeds the expected input size. A buffer overflow would cause an\r\napplication to fail or perform unusually, but a buffer overflow would not\r\nappear as a redirected web server from a DNS lookup.\r\nB. Wireless deauthentication\r\nWireless deauthentication would cause users on a wireless network to\r\nconstantly disconnect. Wireless deauthentication would not cause a\r\nredirection of a website.\r\nC. Amplified DDoS\r\nAn amplified DDOS (Distributed Denial of Service) would attack a\r\nservice from many different devices and cause the service to be unavailable.\r\nThis attack sends specially crafted packets to maximize the amount of\r\ntraffic seen in the response. In this example, the service did not document\r\nany availability problems.",

In this\r\nexample, the password and smart card are two factors of authentication,\r\nand both reasonably prove that the person with the login credentials is\r\nauthentic.\r\nThe incorrect answers:\r\nA.

In this example, the authentication process uses\r\ninternal information without any type of connection or trust to a\r\nthird-party.\r\nB.
