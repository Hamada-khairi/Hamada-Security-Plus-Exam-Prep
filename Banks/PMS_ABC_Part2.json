      "explanation": "The Answer: D. Loss of intellectual property\r\nThe exfiltration of confidential information and intellectual property is\r\nrelatively simple with an easily transportable mobile phone. Organizations\r\nassociated with sensitive products or services must always be aware of the\r\npotential for information leaks using files, photos, or video.\r\nThe incorrect answers:\r\nA. Unauthorized software on rooted devices\r\nAlthough unauthorized software use can be a security issue, it isn’t as\r\nsignificant as the exfiltration of intellectual property.\r\nB. Remote access clients on the mobile devices\r\nIt’s sometimes convenient to have a remote access client available, and this\r\ntype of access can certainly be a concern if the proper security is not in\r\nplace. However, the much more significant security issue in this list would\r\nbe associated with the ease of photos and videography when working with\r\nconfidential information.\r\nC. Out of date mobile operating systems\r\nHaving an outdated operating system can potentially include security\r\nvulnerabilities, but these vulnerabilities do not have the significance of an\r\nactive data exfiltration method.",

Create a separate daily backup archive for all\r\napplicable tax records\r\nAn important consideration for a data retention mandate is to always have\r\naccess to the information over the proposed time frame. In this example,\r\na daily backup would ensure tax information is constantly archived over\r\na seven year period and could always be retrieved if needed. If data was\r\ninadvertently deleted from the primary storage, the backup would still\r\nmaintain a copy.\r\nThe incorrect answers:\r\nA. Automate a script to remove all tax information more than\r\nseven years old\r\nThe requirement is to maintain data for at least seven years, but there’s no\r\nrequirement to remove that data after that time frame. For example, some\r\nfinancial information may need to be retained well beyond the seven year\r\nmandate.\r\nB.
