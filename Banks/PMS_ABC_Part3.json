Firewall rules must be\r\nbuilt to match the traffic flows, and only then will traffic pass through the\r\nfirewall.\r\nThe incorrect answers:\r\nA. Create a single firewall rule with an explicit deny\r\nBy default, most firewalls have an implicit deny as the last policy in the\r\nfirewall rules. If traffic does not match any other firewall rule, then the\r\nimplicit deny drops the traffic. Manually configuring an explicit deny\r\ndoesn’t provide any additional traffic control because of the alreadyexisting\r\nimplicit deny, and it doesn’t allow any traffic to pass through the\r\nfirewall because the rule itself denies all traffic.\r\nB. Build a separate VLAN for the application\r\nVLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) separation can be used to manage\r\ntraffic flows or provide additional security options, but creating a VLAN\r\nwon’t bypass an existing firewall deny rule.\r\nD.

An attacker could potentially perform a spraying attack\r\nacross many accounts without any noticeable alerts or alarms.\r\nThe incorrect answers:\r\nA. Downgrade attack\r\nA downgrade attack takes advantage of a cryptographic weakness or\r\nvulnerability to gain access. This weakness is often due to an unpatched\r\napplication or a poorly implemented cryptographic process. In this\r\nexample, the attack is focused on a small number of brute force attempts\r\nand not on a cryptographic issue.\r\nB. Phishing\r\nPhishing is a useful attack for gathering information.

Tune the IPS signatures\r\nAn IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) can identify and block known\r\nexploits within network traffic.

It’s common to add some\r\nadditional random data (a salt) to a password before the hashing process.\r\nThis ensures that each password is truly random when stored, and it makes\r\nit more difficult for an attacker to discover all of the stored passwords.\r\nThe incorrect answers:\r\nA.
